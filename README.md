# Ethereum Swarm Beekeeper

[![Go](https://github.com/ethersphere/beekeeper/workflows/Go/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ethersphere/beekeeper/actions)

**Ethereum Swarm Beekeeper** is tool used for testing of [Ethereum Swarm Bee](https://github.com/ethersphere/bee).

# Installing

```bash
make binary
cp dist/beekeeper /usr/local/bin/beekeeper
```

# Usage

**beekeeper** has following commands:

|command|description|
|-------|-----------|
| check | Run tests on Bee node(s) |
| help | Help about any command |
| version | Print version number |

## check

Command **check** runs test(s) on Bee node(s).
 Each test is implemented as a subcommand.

Available subcommands:

|subcommand|description|
|----------|-----------|
| fullconnectivity | Checks full connectivity in the cluster |
| kademlia | Checks Kademlia topology in the cluster |
| peercount | Count peers for all nodes in the cluster |
| pingpong | Executes ping from all nodes to all other nodes in the cluster |
| pushsync | Checks pushsync ability of the cluster |
| retrieval | Checks retrieval ability of the cluster |

### fullconnectivity

**fullconnectivity** checks if every node has connectivity to all other nodes in the cluster.

Example:
```bash
beekeeper check fullconnectivity --namespace bee --node-count 3
```

### kademlia

**kademlia** checks Kademlia topology in the cluster

Example:
```bash
beekeeper check kademlia --namespace bee --node-count 3
```

### peercount

**peercount** counts peers for all nodes in the cluster.

Example:
```bash
beekeeper check peercount --namespace bee --node-count 3
```

### pingpong

**pingpong** executes ping from all nodes to all other nodes in the cluster,
and prints round-trip time (RTT) of each ping.

Example:
```bash
beekeeper check pingpong --namespace bee --node-count 3
```

### pushsync

**pushsync** checks pushsync ability of the cluster.
It uploads given number of chunks to given number of nodes, and checks if chunks are synced to their closest nodes.

Example:
```bash
beekeeper check pushsync --namespace bee --node-count 3 --upload-node-count 2 --chunks-per-node 4
```

### retrieval

**retrieval** checks retrieval ability of the cluster.
It uploads given number of chunks to given number of nodes, 
and attempts retrieval of those chunks from the last node in the cluster.

Example:
```bash
beekeeper check retrieval --namespace bee --node-count 3 --upload-node-count 2 --chunks-per-node 4
```
